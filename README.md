# CoulombMatrix

This project was part of the Key Concepts in Python module for the Digital Chemistry MSc at Imperial College London. This script can be used to generate molecular descriptors, from xyz files containing spacial information of the atoms that make up molecules, that can be used to train machine learning algorithms with applications in Chemistry and Material Science.
