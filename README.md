# CoulombMatrix

This script can be used to generate molecular descriptors (in the form of Coulomb Matrices) from xyz files containing the spatial information of the atoms that make up molecules. These representations can be used for training machine learning models to learn the relationship between chemical structure and resulting physical properties.
